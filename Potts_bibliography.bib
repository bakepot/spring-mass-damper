	Abstract = {A numerical method is developed for solving the 3D, unsteady, incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in Cartesian domains containing immersed boundaries of arbitrary geometrical complexity moving with prescribed kinematics. The governing equations are discretized on a hybrid staggered/non-staggered grid layout using second-order accurate finite-difference formulas. The discrete equations are integrated in time via a second-order accurate dual-time-stepping, artificial compressibility iteration scheme. Unstructured, triangular meshes are employed to discretize complex immersed boundaries. The nodes of the surface mesh constitute a set of Lagrangian control points used to track the motion of the flexible body. At every instant in time, the influence of the body on the flow is accounted for by applying boundary conditions at Cartesian grid nodes located in the exterior but in the immediate vicinity of the body by reconstructing the solution along the local normal to the body surface.

Unsteady hydrodynamics around an undulatory swimming body is solved using a time-accurate solution of the three-dimensional, incompressible, laminar Navier–Stokes equations.

The method is validated by an extensive numerical study of the thrust generation of an oscillating airfoil, involving comparisons with reliable experimental results. For a three-dimensional tadpole model that undergoes undulatory swimming, the hydrodynamics and mechanism of the undulatory swimming were then analyzed and compared with conventional hydrodynamic theories, which provide a general understanding of the relationship between the dynamic vortex flow and the jet-stream propulsion associated with undulatory locomotion of vertebrates.},

The quest for answers has been driven by conceptual advances in fluid dynamics, starting with ideas on the boundary layer and drag initiated by Prandtl, and in measurement techniques starting with force balances focussing on drag and thrust. Drag (=thrust) from measurements on physical models, carcasses, kinematics as inputs to hydromechanical models, and physiological power sources vary from less than that expected for an equivalent rigid reference to over an order of magnitude greater. Estimates of drag and thrust using recent advances largely made possible by increased computing power have not resolved the discrepancy.

Based on existing kinematic and morphological data, a piston and tube apparatus was constructed to produce circular vortex rings with the same size and disc loading as a hovering hawkmoth. Results show that the artificial rings were initially laminar, but developed turbulence owing to azimuthal wave instability. The initial impulse and circulation were accurately estimated for laminar rings using particle image velocimetry; after the transition to turbulence, initial circulation was generally underestimated. The underestimate for turbulent rings can be corrected if the transition time and velocity profile are accurately known, but this correction will not be feasible for experiments on real animals. It is therefore crucial that the circulation and impulse be estimated while the wake vortices are still laminar. The scaling of the ring Reynolds number suggests that flying animals of},

	Abstract = {Engineers and biologists have long desired to compare propulsive performance for fishes and underwater vehicles of different sizes, shapes, and modes of propulsion. Ideally, such a comparison would be made on the basis of either propulsive efficiency, total power output or both. However, estimating the efficiency and power output of self-propelled bodies, and particularly fishes, is methodologically challenging because it requires an estimate of thrust. For such systems traveling at a constant velocity, thrust and drag are equal, and can rarely be separated on the basis of flow measured in the wake. This problem is demonstrated using flow fields from swimming American eels, Anguilla rostrata, measured using particle image velocimetry (PIV) and high-speed video. Eels balance thrust and drag quite evenly, resulting in virtually no wake momentum in the swimming (axial) direction. On average, their wakes resemble those of self-propelled jet propulsors, which have been studied extensively.},

Their results showed that vortex rings generated from starting jets stop forming and pinch off from the generating jet for sufficiently large values of the piston stroke to diameter ratio (L/D), suggesting a maximization principle may exist for propulsion utilizing starting jets. The importance of vortex ring formation and pinch off to propulsion, however, rests on the relative contribution of the leading vortex ring and the trailing jet (which appears after pinch off) to the impulse supplied to the flow. To resolve the relative importance of the vortex ring and trailing jet for propulsion, a piston-cylinder mechanism attached to a force balance is used to investigate the impulse and thrust generated by starting jets for L/D ratios in the range 2-8.

	Abstract = {Fish larvae, like many adult fish, swim by undulating their body. However, their body size and swimming speeds put them in the intermediate flow regime, where viscous and inertial forces both play an important role in the interaction between fish and water. To study the influence of the relatively high viscous forces compared with adult fish, we mapped the flow around swimming zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae using two-dimensional digital particle image velocimetry (2D-DPIV) in the horizontal and transverse plane of the fish. Fish larvae initiate a swimming bout by bending their body into a C shape. During this initial tail-beat cycle, larvae shed two vortex pairs in the horizontal plane of their wake, one during the preparatory and one during the subsequent propulsive stroke. When they swim cyclically' (mean swimming speed does not change significantly between tail beats), fish larvae generate a wide drag wake along their head and anterior body. The flow along the posterior body is dom},

	abstract = "When a body oscillates laterally (cross-flow) in a free stream, it can synchronize the vortex formation frequency with the body motion frequency. This fundamental “lock-in” regions is but one in a whole series of synchronization regions, which have been found in the present paper, in an amplitude-wavelength plane (defining the body trajectory) up to amplitudes of five diameters. In the fundamental region, it is shown that the acceleration of the cylinder each half cycle induces the roll-up of the two shear layers close to the body, and thereby the formation of four regions of vorticity each cycle. Below a critical wavelength, each half cycle sees the coalescence of a pair of like-sign vortices and the development of a Karman-type wake. However, beyond this wavelength the like-sign vortices convect away from each other, and each of them pairs with an opposite-sign vortex. The resulting wake comprises a system of vortex pairs which can convect away from the wake centerline. The process of pairing causes the transition between these modes to be sudden, and this explains the sharp change in the character of the cylinder forces observed by Bishop and Hassan, and also the jump in the phase of the lift force relative to body displacement. At precisely the critical wavelength, only two regions of vorticity are formed, and the resulting shed vorticity is more concentrated than at other wavelengths. We interpret this particular case as a condition of “resonant synchronization”, and it corresponds with the peak in the body forces observed in Bishop and Hassan's work."

	abstract ={1. If the resistance of an actively swimming dolphin is equal to that of a rigid model towed at the same speed, the muscles must be capable of generating energy at a rate at least seven times greater than that of other types of mammalian muscle.2. Observation of the flow of particles past the surface of models similar in form to a fish or dolphin shows that rhythmical movements, such as are characteristic of the body and caudal fin of the living animals, exert an accelerating effect on the surrounding water in the direction of the posterior end of the model. An effect of this type may be expected to prevent turbulence in the flow of water past the body.3. If the flow of water past the body of a dolphin is free from turbulence, the horse-power developed per pound of muscle agrees closely with that of other types of mammalian muscle.},

	Abstract = {Oscillating foils produce thrust through the development of a jet-like average flow. It is found that such jets are convectively unstable with a narrow range of frequencies of maximum amplification, resulting in the formation of a staggered array of vortices with direction opposite to that of the classical Karman street. A stable co-existence of the jet profile and the large-scale patterns is ensured only at the frequency of maximum amplification, hence at this frequency optimal efficiency is obtained, i.e., maximum thrust per unit input energy. The nondimensional frequency of maximum amplification (Strouhal number) is in the range of 0·25 to 0·35. Experiments confirms this results, while the analysis of a large number of data from observations on fish and cetaceans confirm that optimal fish propulsion is achieved within this range of Strouhal number. <I>Copyright 1993, 1999 Academic Press</I>},

	Abstract = {The definition of some special lines in a flow field is discussed and a criterion for the identification of axes of local rotation is given. A preferred direction is introduced in space using the local direction of the velocity. A surface is constructed locally such that at any point the surface is normal to the velocity field. For a (normalized) direction field of the velocity, the components of the gradient tensor on this surface can be regarded as being equivalent to the curvature tensor of the surface. The behaviour of the curvature is discussed. The surface is partitioned into hyperbolic and elliptic regions by the sign of the Gaussian curvature. It is found that the special points are associated with regions of extremely steep variations of the Gaussian curvature. Experimental evidence to this effect if provided by measurements of wall shear stress vectors and velocity vectors in the flow field around an inclined prolate spheroid. The above procedure is shown to be a tool for re},
